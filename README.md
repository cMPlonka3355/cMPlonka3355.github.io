# cMPlonka3355.github.io
Personal repository for my own website.

This project is meant to host the design for a personal website, in order to solve the issue of providing myself a means to represent myself on the Internet. It is meant to display certain information about myself for employers to look at and use to see if I would be a good fit for any future project they would like work for. 

To provide feedback on this project, as well as to obtain information regarding it, persons can email me at klonothew@gmail.com. I can also be contacted through that email for the purpose of providing contributions to this project, and the standard process of making push and pull requests to this repository can be done.

Any contributions to be made to this project should be done using the HTML coding standards laid out by CKAN. The standard can be found here: https://docs.ckan.org/en/2.9/contributing/html.html. Alongside that, all contributions must be submitted with a corresponding email detailing the purpose of the contribution and what actions it performs. Contributions to add tests for functions shall follow this same process.

To report a vulnerability, I can be emailed through the email above or an issue report can be submitted through the issues tag of this GitHub repository. Issues will then be reviewed and I will respond to them as soon as I can.

Testing for this site will be done through Selenium. In order to run the tests for the site, ensure that the link for the site is listed in the get() function for the driver you are using. Afterwards, use standard testing protocols for Selenium to check the accessibility and functionality of certain parts of the website.

Any major updates to the project that adds new functionality shall also add tests to ensure that such functionality works. While conributions can be made for both normal functions and for tests, I will be the one ensuring that the testing for any fucntions works properly. Thus it is not required for others to do the testing of the site, as I will ensure full testing to the best of my abilities.
